# 🧩 Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

---

## 🎯 Objective
To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its strength using free online password testing tools.  
The goal is to identify how password length, complexity, and randomness improve overall security.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com)   
- Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell  
- Windows Snipping Tool (for screenshots)

---

## 🧠 Steps Performed

1. Created a folder named **Task6-Password-Security** on the desktop.  
2. Prepared a file named **password_list.txt** containing several passwords with different complexity levels.  
3. Opened the **PasswordMeter** tool and tested each password individually.  
4. Observed strength scores and feedback for each password.  
5. Captured screenshots of the password test results and saved them in the **screenshots/** folder.  
6. Recorded all password strengths, feedback, and conclusions in **password_results.md**.  
7. Documented all the commands and steps followed in **commands.txt**.  
8. Compiled this **README.md** to summarize the entire task.

## 📊 Password Strength Summary

| No. | Password (for testing only) | Strength (%) | Feedback / Observations |
|:---:|:-----------------------------|:-------------:|:------------------------|
| 1 | **aritraadak** | 8% (Very Weak) | Contains only lowercase letters; short and predictable. |
| 2 | **AritraAdak** | 36% (Weak) | Mixed case but no numbers or special characters. |
| 3 | **Aritra12** | 59% (Good) | Includes numbers, but lacks symbols and longer length. |
| 4 | **@Aritra12** | 75% (Strong) | Excellent mix of upper, lower, digits, and symbols; good length. |
| 5 | **Aritra#!Tiger2025** | 100% (Very Strong) | Long passphrase, includes symbols and numbers; highly secure. |

## 🔍 Observations & Learnings

### 🔸 Password Length
- Longer passwords are much harder to crack.  
- Each additional character increases possible combinations exponentially.

### 🔸 Complexity & Variation
- Using uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols greatly increases strength.  
- Avoid dictionary words, names, or common phrases.

### 🔸 Attack Types
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations.  
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses lists of common passwords.  
- **Hybrid Attack:** Mixes dictionary words with symbols or numbers.

### 🔸 Security Best Practices
- Use **at least 12–16 characters** for strong passwords.  
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.  
- Create **passphrases** using random, unrelated words.  
- Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.  
- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added protection.  
- Use a **Password Manager** to store and generate strong passwords safely.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This task demonstrated how password length and complexity affect resistance to common attacks.  
By analyzing results from password strength tools, it is clear that long, complex, and unpredictable passwords offer the best protection.  
Practicing secure password habits and using MFA significantly enhances overall cybersecurity.

✅ **Outcome:**  
Learned practical password evaluation, security best practices, and how to identify strong vs weak password patterns.
